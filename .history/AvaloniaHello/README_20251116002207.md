# AvaloniaHello

A minimal Avalonia 11 cross-platform sample that renders the same "Hello from Avalonia everywhere" view across Windows, macOS, Linux (desktop), Android, iOS, and the browser (WebAssembly).

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8.0 or newer (`dotnet --version`).
- Avalonia project templates (install/update anytime):

  ```bash
  dotnet new install Avalonia.Templates
  ```
- Platform workloads:
  - Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux): included with .NET SDK.
  - Browser: install the WebAssembly workload the first time you publish/run in the browser (`dotnet workload install wasm-tools`).
  - Android: `dotnet workload install android` plus Android Studio (SDK + emulator/device) on your machine.
  - iOS: `dotnet workload install ios maccatalyst` on macOS, plus Xcode/Xcode Command Line Tools. Physical device deployment also needs an Apple developer profile.

## Restore & build everything

```bash
cd AvaloniaHello
 dotnet restore
 dotnet build
```

## Run targets

| Platform | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) | ```bash
dotnet run --project AvaloniaHello.Desktop
``` | Uses the classic desktop lifetime; works on any OS supported by the .NET SDK. |
| Browser (WebAssembly) | ```bash
dotnet publish AvaloniaHello.Browser -c Release
```
Open `AvaloniaHello.Browser/bin/Release/net8.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle/index.html` via a local web server. | Install `wasm-tools` workload first. |
| Android | ```bash
dotnet build AvaloniaHello.Android -t:Run -f net8.0-android
``` | Requires an attached/emulated device visible to `adb`. Use `-p:AndroidSdkDirectory=` if Android SDK is in a non-default path. |
| iOS (simulator) | ```bash
dotnet build AvaloniaHello.iOS -t:Run -f net8.0-ios /p:_DeviceName=:v2:udid=<sim-udid>
``` | Replace `<sim-udid>` with `dotnet ios simulator list` output. For device builds, pass signing identities with `/p:CodesignKey=` and `/p:CodesignProvision=`. |

## Project layout

- `AvaloniaHello/` – shared UI, view models, assets.
- `AvaloniaHello.Desktop/` – classic desktop entry point.
- `AvaloniaHello.Android/` – Android-specific host (`MainActivity`).
- `AvaloniaHello.iOS/` – iOS single-view host.
- `AvaloniaHello.Browser/` – WebAssembly host with minimal HTML shell.
- `Directory.Packages.props` – central package management pinning the Avalonia version.

## Next steps

- Use `dotnet workload update` periodically to keep mobile tooling current.
- Hook platform-specific services (e.g., notifications, file pickers) in the respective head projects.
- Add MVVM-friendly services and unit tests by extending the shared project.
